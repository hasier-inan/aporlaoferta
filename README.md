Aporlaoferta was shut down in late 2017 when Openshift removed their free tier and required some amendments to make it work in their new environments. The application had a very small community, so it was not a big loss. Nowadays better options can be found in the spanish community with the same purpose.

This repository is the result of the original Openshift repositories migration. Encrypted properties and flyway scripts were dismissed when the branch was pushed. All domains were shut down, as the application was no longer active/supported.
